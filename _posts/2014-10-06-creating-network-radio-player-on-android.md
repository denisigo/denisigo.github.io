title: Creating Network Radio Player on Android
category: Android

Hi, today I'm gonna show you how to create a simple Android network radio client which you can use to listen to your favorite station - just type in one's URL! For the sake of simplicity, I'll try to divide this topic into several articles starting from the simplest version - v1. This version will only support plain stream (Shoutcast, Icecast) of the "audio/mpeg" type and will have minimal sufficient amount of code. I'll try to evolve this app during the time and write about it here. As always, check out the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/denisigo/NetRadioPlayer/tree/v1).
